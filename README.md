# Rossmann kaggle challenge

This is my attemp at solving the kaggle challenge at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales).

The three notebooks are an exploratory analysis of the data, a benchmark to beat by my model and then my model. I used geometric mean as a benchmark and I used boosted trees for the prediction model.

Please notice that the data need to be downloaded from kaggle, in my files organization they where in another directory called 'csv', but it should be clear from the code.
