# Rossmann kaggle challenge

This is my attemp at solving the kaggle challenge at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales).

The three notebooks are an exploratory analysis of the data, a benchmark to beat by my model and then my model. I used geometric mean as a benchmark and I used boosted trees for the prediction model.
